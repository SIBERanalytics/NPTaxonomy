![alt text](https://github.com/SIBERanalytics/NPTaxonomy/blob/main/overview_figure.png?raw=true)

## Overview

This repository contains source data and python scripts for natural products (NPs) taxonomical classification and structural insights. From the LOTUS database (https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/download), the multiclassification of NPs within five kingdoms (animal, bacteria, chromista, fungi, and plant) are performed for 133,092 NPs.

The generated results and figures are presented in the manuscript titled â€œComposite Machine Learning Strategy for Natural Products Taxonomical Classification and Structural Insights".

## Environment
The python packages in the conda environment for performing the taxonomical classification and structural insights are provided the yaml file (`environment.yml`).

## Instruction
In the folder `1_dataset_preparation/`
- Run the script `1_data_curation.py` to process the `lotusUniqueNaturalProduct.bson` (obtained from LOTUS database) and curate the dataframe `df_curated.csv` for data exploration.
- Run the script `2_data_exploration_preparation.py` to process the `df_curated.csv` and generate the machine learning dataset `np_5classes.csv` for taxonomical classification. The machine learning dataset `np_5classes.csv` consists of the non-isomeric SMILES of 133092 natural products (NPs) from five different kingdoms ([animal, bacteria, chromista, fungi, plant] = [0,1,2,3,4]). The exploratory figures will also be plotted.

In the folder `2_models/2.1_GCNN_model/`
- Run the script `1_train_GCNN_model.py` to train a GCNN model for the machine learning dataset.
- Run the script `2_LOTUS_MPN_lastFFN_fingerprint.py` to generate the MPN (`lotus_MPN.csv`) and last_FFN (`lotus_last_FFN.csv`) fingerprints of 133092 NPs from LOTUS database.
- Run the script `3_NPAtlas_screening.py` to screen 13136 NPs (bacteria and fungi) from NPAtlas dataset (`npatlas_dataset.csv`) using the trained GCNN model; the prediction is `npatlas_preds.csv`. The MPN (`npatlas _MPN.csv`) and last_FFN (`npatlas _last_FFN.csv`) fingerprints of 13136 NPs of are also generated.

In the folder `2_models/2.2_SVM_models/`
- Run the script `1_train_model_SVM_MPN.py` to construct a SVM model (`model_SVM_MPN`) based the MPN fingerprints of the machine learning dataset (`lotus_MPN.csv`).
- Run the script `2_train_model_SVM_last_FFN.py` to construct a SVM model (`model_SVM_last_FFN`) based the MPN fingerprints of the machine learning dataset (`lotus_ last_FFN.csv`).
- Run the script `3_SVM_prediction_NPAtlas.py` to screen 13136 NPs from NPAtlas dataset (`npatlas_dataset.csv`) using the constructed SVM models (`model_SVM_MPN`and `model_SVM_last_FFN`).

In the folder `3_structural_analysis/3.1_tsne_analysis/`
- Run the script `tsne_analysis.py` to plot and compare the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Davies-Bouldin (DB) score of three different fingerprints (MAP4, MPN and last_FFN) of the 133092 NPs from LOTUS database. The KL divergence and DB score are plotted as function of the perplexity parameter in t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis.

In the folder `3_structural_analysis/3.2_tsne_comparison/`
- Run the script `tsne_map.py` to t-sne mapping of three different fingerprints (MAP4, MPN and last_FFN) of the machine learning dataset 133092 NPs.

In the folder `3_structural_analysis/3.3_critical_substructures/`
- Run the script `critical_substructures.py` to plot the top ten critical substructures of each kingdom from the machine learning dataset 133092 NPs.
